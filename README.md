# Cute2D
A cute 2D game engine

Aim of this project is to create a user friendly 2D game engine which supports various platforms 
including Windows,Linux,Mac,Android etc.

Game engine will use SDL or either DirectX/OpenGL for its backend
Engine will use Python for scripting and any C++ native library could be imported.

Cute2D includes an editor called Cute Editor
For designers this will include a Visual Scripting system which runs python commands from Designer.

This game engine mainly target Top Down RPG style games.
So tile painting will be easier here than any other availble.
